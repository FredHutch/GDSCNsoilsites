# Education

The following are materials designed to help you dive into BioDIGS. This could be for your own learning, or for you to implement in your classrooms!

Activities leverage NHGRI's [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/) cloud computing platform. AnVIL is the preferred computing platform for the [GDSCN](https://www.gdscn.org/home). However, all of the activities can be done using personal installations of R or using the online [Galaxy](usegalaxy.org) portal.

## BioDIGS: Exploring Soil Data

Explore soil data and metadata from the BioDIGS Project! In this activity, students are guided through basic data wrangling tasks using the R programming language as they examine the soil characteristics of BioDIGS sampling locations. Students learn how to load data into R, install and open packages, calculate basic statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum), and plot both histograms and boxplots.

The activities in this guide are written for undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. No prior experience with the R programming language is required. Students should have access to an installation of RStudio, which can be accessed through [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/) or [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=IDE_Download), or can be [downloaded](https://posit.co/downloads/) for free from Posit.
