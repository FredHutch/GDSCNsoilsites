Field,Description
bulk_type,"Describes the testing that will be performed. ""Molecular"" indicates this sample will be sent to a DNA sequencing facility."
purpose,Describes whether the sample was intended to be part of the Project or part of Troubleshooting sample processing.
vessel,Describes what the sample was stored in by collector prior to being prepared for sequencing.
collection_date,The date the sample was removed from the ground by the collector at the site.
site_name_rep_detail,Descriptive sample and/or site detail provided by the collector
partner_faculty,"Faculty parter responsible for collecting the sample and mailing it to JHU, if applicable"
team,"Names of sample collectors who assisted the partner_faculty, if applicable"
site_id,A unique ID for each site consisting of letter(s) followed by a number. A site is a specific geographic location and may have multiple samples collected there at different time points.
replicate,"A replicate ID. Replicates are identical at the site_id, partner_faculty, team, and collection_date level, and represent the same sample but a different physical vessel to be processed."
sample_id,"A unique combination of bulk_type, site_id, and replicate"
date_arrival_at_jhu,Date on which the sample was received at JHU.
status,"Current physical status of the sample, indicating whether it has been sent for processing from JHU."
date_sent_seq,Date on which the sample was sent or delivered to the sequencing facility.
sequencing_facility,Facility where sample was sent for molecular/metagenomic analysis
sequencing_instrument,"The kind of sequencer that was used: Nova-seq, PacBio Revio etc."
DNA_OK,TRUE if DNA was successfully extracted. FALSE if no DNA was available or it was too degraded to perform sequencing.
Qubit_conc_ng_ul,"Concentration of DNA as measured by Qubit instrument, in nanograms per microliter"
seq_date,Date the sample was sequenced
filename,"Name and path of the sequencing file that is available to BioDIGS partners, either on AnVIL or Galaxy."
md5sum,"A file checksum, specifically one generated using the MD5 hashing algorithm.ÊIt's a 128-bit fingerprint of a file, used to verify its integrity by ensuring no changes have been made to the file since the checksum was generated"
raw_id,File naming convention used to help disambiguate samples received from the sequencing facility. Often the sequencing facility will have random file naming.
Note,"Additional information about the sample collection or processing, if applicable"
public_ok,Internal field indicating if the collector has provided public sharing permissions. Value is TRUE if there are no restrictions on sharing.
